# Serengeti Research

The vast plains of the Serengeti are where the **GNU** animals (Wildebeest) run free. This project is called Serengeti Research because this is where *Wildesoftware* runs free. Here you will see ***possibly*** useful projects.. or it may be just something more of a research project (it is in the name after all :smiley:).

We know this sounds vague as a description. Here is a brief description of the first project repository that will reside here.

## Terminal Control

Terminal Control is a Windows Forms custom control that can use emulation and protocol plug-ins. The VT emulation level of the DEC emulation plug-in can almost reach VT400ish levels. The SSH protocol uses the SSH.NET project NuGet API to communicate with SSH servers.
